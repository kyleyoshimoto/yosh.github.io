            <h2>A little about me:</h2>
                <p class="bio">I was born and raised in Southern California. 
                I currently am attending University of California, Santa Barbara and pursuing a bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics. 
                After I obtain my degree, I am interested in becoming a full-stack software developer one day so I can make the world a more efficient and better place for everyone.
                I plan to do this by attending a professional coding bootcamp after I graduate from UCSB.
                A passion for programming and technology is why I have choosen to pursue this route. 
                It truly is amazing what can be done with a modern-day computer and I am excited to see what will be achieveable in the next few years. The sky is the limit.
                Other than programming, I enjoy activities such as fishing, surfing, beach volleyball and any other outdoor activity.</p>

            <h2>Film photography</h2>
                <p>I have recently came across a Minolta 110 Zoom SLR that was collecting dust in my parents closet. 
                    With this point and shoot film camera, I have just started my hobby of film photography.
                    110 film is known as the forgotten form of film which makes it hard to purchase film and get it developed. 
                    The film is relatively inexpensive and the only place I can find it is on Amazon.com. 
                    I have come across this cool little place called Dexter's Camera Laboratory in Ventura, CA where I can get my photos developed and printed.
