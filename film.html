                    <p>The south-east side of one of the Southern-California Channel Islands: Santa Cruz Island. A 40~ minute boat ride from Ventura Harbor to this area called "Yellowbanks". Taken while in search of White Seabass, Halibut, whitefish, or if we were lucky; California Yellowtail. With the correct south swell, this area forms a long right point break for surfing.</p>

                    <p>This was captured on a sunny day at Rincon point in Carpinteria, CA. I was checking the waves and decided to bring my camera for my walk down to the shore. Rincon is a world-famous right-point surf spot and this day was about 3-4ft and overall pretty fun. What an awesome place to live.</p>

                    <p>The glassy rolling waves in front of the house that I live in at the moment are a hidden gem of Isla Vista. Theres nothing like surfing a break that you have all to yourself. On the right swell direction, sometimes these waves get quite tall and hollow and you can score yourself time in the tube for a quick second. Seems to only happen a couple times a year so you have to jump on the opportunity when presented.</p>

                    <p>My rusty beach cruiser that I ride almost everyday to campus and to check the surf. I bought it for $20 from a middle-aged couple that didn't have any use for it anymore. Despite the chain falling off every-other time I ride it, its probably the best $20 I've ever spent.</p>
